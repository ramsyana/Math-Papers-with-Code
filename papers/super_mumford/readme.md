# Super Mumford

A mathematical library implementing advanced concepts from algebraic geometry and string theory, focusing on super Mumford forms and related mathematical structures.

## Project Background

## Research Objectives

The project aims to implement and explore:
- Super Sato Grassmannian structures
- Neveu-Schwarz group representations
- Super tau functions
- Laurent series with supersymmetric properties
- Algebraic and geometric constructions in superstring theory
